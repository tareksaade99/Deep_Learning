# Deep Learning Course â€“ Group Projects

This folder contains a collection of **group projects** completed as part of the **Deep Learning course**.  
Each project applies deep learning methods to real-world data, combining theory, implementation, and analysis.

The projects cover areas such as:
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** tweet sentiment classification and identification of sentiment-relevant words using traditional and transformer-based models  
- **Computer Vision:** cactus detection from images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs)  
- **Audio Analysis:** anomaly detection in machine sounds through deep feature extraction and classification models  

These works demonstrate teamwork, experimentation, and practical understanding of how deep learning techniques can be adapted across diverse domains.
