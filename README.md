# Deep Learning Course – Group Projects

This folder contains a collection of **group projects** completed as part of the **Deep Learning course**.  
Each project explores a different application of modern deep learning techniques, combining theoretical understanding with practical implementation.

The projects cover areas such as:
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – tweet sentiment classification using traditional and transformer-based models  
- **Model interpretability** – identifying sentiment-relevant words through attention and gradient-based methods  
- **Comparative evaluation** – analyzing performance, computational efficiency, and limitations of different approaches  

These works reflect collaborative experimentation, hands-on learning, and critical analysis of deep learning methods applied to real-world data.
